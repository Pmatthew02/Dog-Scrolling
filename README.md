What the dog doing is an app to just look at dogs and just solely that.

I made a button that would select an image from the api at random.
I used a div in my html to give the page some dimension so that the photos felt they werent in a 1 dimension field.
In my javascript I turned my title into an array so that I could loop thru the letters so that when the page loads the letters do a wave motion.

some of the problems I had was getting the photos to come up. I tried a handful of different approaches to get it to work, after a few different ways of coding it,i finally got it. i wanted to do a carousel slide on my page but was having a hard time figuring out carousel.
As for the photos they are different sizes I wasnt sure on how to make them the same size.
